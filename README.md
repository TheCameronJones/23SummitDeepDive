## Project Description
In cheerleading competitions, there is always a push to see who the best is. It is easy when you are looking at one division because the best person is the winner. However, when you are trying to compare across divisions it starts to become difficult because of the subjective nature of the sport and differences between judging panels. This project answers the question, who is the best.
